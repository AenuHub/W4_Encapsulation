## W4_Encapsulation - Car Class Example

In this exercise, aiming to create a `Car` class in C#. The class will have properties that define the characteristics of a car, including encapsulation for the number of doors.

### Car Class Properties:
- **Make**: The manufacturer of the car.
- **Model**: The specific model of the car.
- **Color**: The color of the car.
- **Number of Doors**: The total number of doors on the car (encapsulated property).

### Encapsulation for Number of Doors:
The `NumberOfDoors` property will only accept values of 2 or 4. If an attempt is made to assign a value other than these, a warning message will be displayed on the console, and the value will be set to -1.
